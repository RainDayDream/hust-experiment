		<p>When you open Packet Tracer, by default you will be presented with the 
			following interface:</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>This initial interface contains ten components. If you are unsure of what a 
			particular interface item does, move your mouse over the item and a help 
			balloon will explain the item.</p>

		<p class="MainHeading2">Workspaces and Modes</p>
		<p class="myList">Packet Tracer has two workspaces (Logical and Physical) and 
			two modes (Realtime and Simulation). Upon startup, you are in the Logical 
			Workspace in Realtime Mode. You can build your network and see it run in real 
			time in this configuration. You can switch to Simulation Mode to run controlled 
			networking scenarios. You can also switch to the Physical Workspace to arrange 
			the physical aspects (such as the location) of your devices. Note that you view 
			a simulation while you are in the Physical Workspace. You should return to 
			the Logical Workspace after you are done in the Physical Workspace.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MainHeading2">Setting Preferences</p>
		<p>
			You can customize your Packet Tracer experience by setting your own 
			preferences. From the <strong>Menu Bar</strong>, select <strong>Options</strong> > <strong>Preferences</strong>
			(or simply press <strong>Ctrl + R</strong>) to view the program settings.</p>
		<p>Under the <strong>Interface</strong> panel, you can toggle the <strong>Animation</strong>,
			<strong>Sound</strong>, and </strong><strong>Show Link Lights</strong> settings 
			to suit the performance of your system and your preferences. You can also manage information clutter with 
			the <strong>Show Device Labels</strong>, <strong>Always Show Port Labels</strong>, and <strong>Show Port Labels When Mouse Over</strong> settings. Also, you can also toggle <strong>Show QoS Stamps on Packets</strong> shown in Simulation Mode and <strong>Enable Cable Length Effects</strong>. The <strong>Enable Auto Cable</strong> option allows you to toggle the Automatic Connection when connecting devices. The <strong>Show Device Dialog Taskbar</strong> option allows you to toggle the taskbar that is displayed at the bottom of the workspace which organizes currently opened device dialogs. The <strong>Logging</strong> feature allows the program to capture 
			all Cisco IOS commands that you enter and export them to a text file (refer to 
			the "Configuring Devices" page for more information). The <strong>Simulation - Buffer Full Action</strong> feature allows you to set the preferred action that Packet Tracer will perform. You can set the action to <strong>Prompt</strong> if you want to be prompted when the Simulation buffer is full. At the prompt, you can either <strong>Clear Event List</strong> or <strong>View Previous Events</strong>. Alternatively, you can set the action to either <strong>Auto Clear Event List</strong> to allow Packet Tracer to automatically clear the Event List when the buffer is full or you can set the action to <strong>Auto View Previous Events</strong> to automatically view the previous events. The <strong>Enable Screen 
				Reader Support</strong> accessibility feature reads out all the titles and 
			descriptions of the visible window that has the focus. Lastly, you can also 
			change the  base language of the program by choosing from the <strong>Languages</strong>
			list and then pressing the <strong>Change Language</strong> button.</p>

		<p>Under the <strong>Administrative</strong> panel, you can disable access to a particular interface such as the <strong>Interface tab </strong>and the <strong>Multiuser menu</strong> using the <strong>Interface Locking</strong> feature. In order  settings and configurations to apply globally for every user on the machine, you need to click on the <strong>Write</strong> button to save the PT.conf file to the Packet Tracer installation folder. Optionally, you may change the <strong>User Folder</strong> to a different location which is where your own settings, configurations, save files, and device templates are stored. Additionally, you can set a <strong>Password</strong> to 
			prevent others from tampering with these preferences. Note that the password is 
			case-sensitive.</p>

		<p>Under the <strong>Hide</strong> panel, you can choose to hide or show the 
		<strong>Physical</strong>, <strong>Config</strong>, <strong>CLI</strong>, <strong>Desktop</strong>, <strong>GUI</strong>, <strong>HTML GUI</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong> tabs in the device edit dialog.</p>

		<p class="MainHeading2">Setting a User Profile</p>
		<p>
			You can set your user profile for activity assessment and Multiuser identification. From the <strong>Menu Bar</strong>, select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>User Profile</strong> to view the User Profile dialog. In the User Profile dialog, you can enter your <strong>Name</strong>, <strong>E-Mail</strong>, and any <strong>Additional Info</strong> about yourself that you may want to share.</p>

		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MainHeading2">Algorithm Settings</p>
		<p>The <strong>Algorithms Settings</strong> dialog allows the user to make configurations that are otherwise not available in IOS. It also allows tweaking of algorithm settings to make visualization of certain algorithm/protocol behaviors more easily viewable.</p>
		<p>CBAC <strong>Half-Open Session Multiplier</strong>: If the number of half-open CBAC sessions multiplied by this number exceeds the configured max half-open session count, new sessions would not be opened.</p>
		<p>TCP <strong>Maximum Number of Connections</strong>: If the number of connections in SYN-RECEIVED state exceeds this number, any new connections would be rejected.</p>
		<p>TCP <strong>Maximum Number of Opened Sessions</strong>: If the number of connections exceeds this number, any new connections would be rejected.</p>
		<p>TCP <strong>Maximum Retransmission Timeout in Milliseconds </strong>: If a TCP connection does not receive an acknowledgement to a segment it transmitted in this number, it would retransmit the segment.</p>
		<p>Switching <strong>Storm Control Multiplier</strong>: If the bandwidth percentage of broadcast frames used multiplied by this number exceeds the configured threshold, the broadcast frame would be dropped.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="MainHeading2">Saving a PKZ</p>
		<p>Packet Tracer allows you to save your topology (PKT) as well as any custom device icons and  backgrounds that you applied to on the Logical Workspace and Physical Workspace to a save file called a <strong>PKZ</strong>. A PKZ is able to retain any external files you add in a single save file, which allows for portability and compactness from computer to computer. To create a PKZ, go to <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Save as Pkz</strong>. Enter a file name for the PKZ and click on <strong>Save</strong>. In the <strong>Pkz Select Files</strong> dialog, you will be able to add and remove files that you want to save along with PKT. To add a file, click on the <strong>Add</strong> button and browse to the file you want to add then click <strong>Open</strong>. To remove a file, select the file from the list then click <strong>Remove</strong>. Once you are done adding and removing files, click <strong>OK</strong> to create the PKZ file.</p>
