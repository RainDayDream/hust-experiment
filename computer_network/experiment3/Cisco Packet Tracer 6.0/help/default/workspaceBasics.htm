<p class="MainHeading1">The Logical and Physical Workspaces</p>
<hr>
Packet Tracer uses two representation schemes for your network: the Logical Workspace and the Physical Workspace. The Logical Workspace allows you to build a logical network topology, without regard to its physical scale and arrangement. The Physical Workspace allows you to arrange devices physically in cities, buildings, and wiring closets. Distances and other physical measures will affect network performance and other characteristics if wireless connections are used. In Packet Tracer, you first build your logical network, and then you can arrange it in the Physical Workspace. Most of your time will be spend working in the Logical Workspace.
