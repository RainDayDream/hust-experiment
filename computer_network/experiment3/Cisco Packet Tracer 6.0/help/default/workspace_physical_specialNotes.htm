<hr>
<p class="MainHeading2">Navigation Panel </p>
<p class="myList">You can click on the <strong>Navigation</strong> button from the Physical Workspace Bar to bring up the navigation panel of the entire Physical Workspace. The navigation panel contains a physical locations tree that allows you to select a location and then jump to that particular location on the Physical Workspace. The Navigation panel also allows you to move devices from one place to another in physical mode. This is covered in the Moving Devices section.</p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Applying a Grid</p>
<p class="myList">You can click on the <strong>Grid</strong> button from the Physical Workspace Bar to apply a customizable grid to the Intercity, City, and Building levels. The Grid tool allows you to set the grid spacing for each level and the ability to choose the color of the grid lines. The grid size is in meters and grid size is affected by the by the Set Background image scaling factor.</p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Wiring Closet Limit</p>
<p class="myList">Each wiring closet can house as many as three racks, three tables, two tables and one rack, or two racks and one table. End devices are placed on tables; all other devices are mounted on racks. If the Logical Topology contains more devices than a single wiring closet can house, another wiring closet will automatically be created in the default building. That new wiring closet will become the default wiring closet. You will still be able to access the original wiring closet, although you may need to move wiring closet icons around the building so they do not visually overlap.</p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Deleting Objects</p>
<p class="myList">You can use the <strong>Delete</strong> tool from the Common Tools Bar to delete cities, buildings, and wiring closets. Devices, however, cannot be deleted in the Physical Workspace. If you delete a wiring closet from the Building environment, the devices in that closet will be extracted and placed directly onto the building "floor." If you delete that building from the City environment, the devices will be placed onto the city "streets."</p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MainHeading2">Resizing Objects</p>
<p class="myList">Just as in the Logical Workspace, you can use the <strong>Resize Shape</strong> tool from the Common Tools Bar to resize cities, buildings,  wiring closets, devices, and shapes created drawn with the Drawing Palette.</p>
